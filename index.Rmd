# Introduction

## About

This website is intended as a quick reference for some techniques 
that I think people may need to keep their code reproducible
when cleaning, analyzing, or presenting data. 
For a more basic intro to R try 
[the R for Social Science Data Carpentry Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)
, on which some of this website is based.

The site covers advice on workflows, 
general R techniques such as loops and functions that facilitate reproducibility.
Then the following chapters each cover a part of the research cycle:
design, data cleaning and data analysis (including reporting the results). 
For each, there's specific code examples using survey data. 

## Setting up {#setup}

This book uses the SAFI data set, and a large number of libraries.
Everything is available on [github](https://github.com/kleuveld/r_cheatsheet),
and cloning that repo will ensure you can install all packages through renv 
(see Chapter 1).

Throughout this book, I will mostly make use of `tidyverse` packages.
While there are alternatives that have advantages of this, 
such as `data.table` which is faster,
`tidyverse` makes easily readable code, 
which is imortant from a reproducibility perspective.
Moreover, we are not so concerned with performance, 
since household survey datasets are almost never large enough for that matter.
