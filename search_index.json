For a more basic intro to R try the R for Social Science Data Carpentry Workshop , on which some of this website is based. The site covers advice on workflows, and general R techniques such as loops and functions, as well as specific code examples to do common tasks such as reporting on regressions, power calculations and visualizing data. Setting up This book uses the SAFI data set, and a large number of libraries. The following will download them all. I use the here package to manage paths. #make sure your working folder is set to something sensible! file.create(&quot;.here&quot;) here::i_am(&quot;.here&quot;) library(here) dir.create(here(&quot;data&quot;)) download.file( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/r-socialsci/main/episodes/data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;, here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), mode = &quot;wb&quot; ) install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;,&quot;here&quot;,&quot;arsenal&quot;,&quot;lmtest&quot;,&quot;sandwich&quot;,&quot;here&quot;, &quot;huxtable&quot;,&quot;flextable&quot;,&quot;declaredesign&quot;,&quot;fixest&quot;)) "],["reproducible-workflows.html", "Reproducible Workflows Introduction Projects renv", " Reproducible Workflows Introduction While the code you write should be reproducible, the most important thing is to make sure that you organize your work in such a way that it transfers easily from user to user, and from machine to machine. This helps you, if you need to come back to your own code on a new device (potentially years after initially working on it), and this helps your co-workers, as they can easily use your code. In fact, this website was made using these principles: you can download the all code from github and run it on your own machine. Do note that there is an up-front cost in setting up reproducible workflows, so plan for that, making sure all collaborators are on-board with how you approach the organization of your code and data. This chapter discusses two R-specific aspects of reproducible workflows: projects and the renv package. I also recommend using git, but that goes beyond the scope of this cookbook. Projects Oftentimes, you will see R scripts start with setwd(). This means the script is no longer reproducible, as it relies on the exact folder structure of the machine the script was written on. A better practice is to adopt a project-oriented workflow. In the words of Jenny Bryan: I suggest organizing each data analysis into a project: a folder on your computer that holds all the files relevant to that particular piece of work. I’m not assuming this is an RStudio Project, though this is a nice implementation discussed below. Any resident R script is written assuming that it will be run from a fresh R process with working directory set to the project directory. It creates everything it needs, in its own workspace or folder, and it touches nothing it did not create. For example, it does not install additional packages (another pet peeve of mine). This convention guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work” How to exactly implement this depends on your editor of choice, but most will support some form of project-oriented workflow. RStudio and Sublime text have built-in support for projects, VSCode calls them workspaces. They all have in common that when you open a project, the working directory is properly set, and you’re working with a clean R environment unaffected by whatever other thing you were doing in R just before you switched to work on your current project. As long as you make sure that all scripts and data are in subfolders of your project, you can reference files using relative paths, i.e. paths that start from the project root folder. These relative paths will work on any machine. Here Whether you use RStudio projects VS Code, VIM, Sublime Text, or some custom solution, the here package, makes referencing files in a project-oriented much easier. Any time you include library(here) in a script, it will start looking for the project root folder of the project. This is either the .RProj file, a .git folder for if you use git, or some other file you specify. here will start looking at the current working folder (usually the folder containing the file you just opened), then if it can’t find the file, recursively looks in the parent folder until it’s found. You can then reference files using here(\"path/to\",\"yourfile\"). This path will work wherever you move your file, which is especially useful for RMarkdown files, which tend to ignore your project root folder. Using machine-specific paths Sometimes, you may want to be able to reference files outside your project. This is not great, from a project workflow point of view, but sometimes it can’t be helped. For example, your project lives on git, but you need a file from your teams environment (data is supposed to be on git). To get around this, you can use the .Renviron file, which could be located in your home directory (c:\\users\\%username% on windows) or in your project root folder (if using the project root folder, make sure there’s a way to not sync it with other machines, which git allows), and in it put the following: TEAMS = &quot;C:/path/to/teams&quot; This sets an environment variable called teams if you load your project. Access the variable using Sys.getenv(\"TEAMS\"). So put the following on the top of any script using files from teams: teams_path &lt;- Sys.getenv(&quot;TEAMS&quot;) This way, you can just use teams_path wherever you had wanted to use the path to teams, and it should work for anyone, regardless of the exact path to their teams folder. renv The power of R lies in the many packages that are available. However, here also lies a risk: there’s no guarantee packages keep working the way they work now, meaning that any update may break your work. However, you shouldn’t stay at an old version of a package for all your work, just so that one old project of yours will keep working. What if you want to collaborate with someone using a newer version of that package? [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) gets around this by instead of having a global package library, it has a project-specific project-library. So different projects can use different versions of the same package, without interfering with each other. NB: renv only really works with collaborators if you use some form of version control like git. Something like onedrive, teams or dropbox is difficult, as some folders created by renv should not be shared with co-workers. I am sure there is work-around for this, but since git is so great anyway, I haven’t bothered looking. Starting a project with Renv In RStudio, just tick the box “use renv” when creating a new project. Otherwise, type renv::init(). This will create: The lock file renv.lock, which logs all the packages and their versions. The renv folder, which contains the project package library. Installing new packages with Renv When starting a new project, that project’s library will be empty, so you’ll have to reinstall all packages, just by using install.packages(). Fortunately, renv keeps a global cache of the packages you use across all your projects, so any packages that you already have will install very quickly. After installing the packages, use renv::snapshot() to make sure that all packages are in the lockfile. You should then commit this snapshot to git, so your co-workers can easily update their own packages. Restoring a project If you join an existing project, or copy a project you were working on to a new device, you simply type renv::restore() after opening the project to install all packages listed in the lockfile. That’s it! You now the exact same packages as your co-workers! "],["programming.html", "Programming with R Loops Functions Map() Making functions re-usable with box", " Programming with R Before diving into specific R techniques about managing social science research, first some general programming concepts that will help you make your R code more reusable. These techniques help you move away from the specifics of your data, and make generalizable solutions that you can then reapply to other data sets. This also prevents mistakes, where you copy-paste code and fail to make the necessary changes. But perhaps most importantly, it saves you time: these concepts allow you to do a lot of work with just a few simple building blocks of code. This chapter will cover ways to iterate code (using either loops or the map() function), functions (which will let you easily reuse code snippets you often need), and making code more reusable with the box package. Loops Loops are a fundamental programming concept that allow you to repeat code multiple times without duplicating it. In R, a loop has the following structure: for (i in 1:4){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 The i is the iterator, and each iteration of the loop it takes on the value of a different element of the object that follows the in; in this case, i takes on 1,2,3 and finally 4 as its values. Therefore, this code is equivalent to: print(1) ## [1] 1 print(2) ## [1] 2 print(3) ## [1] 3 print(4) ## [1] 4 But it’s much easier to maintain! Imagine having to do 86 iterations: you would need to copy paste the code 85 times every time you want to update something. Using loops, you don’t need to copy-paste a thing, leading to fewer errors. While loops can be a perfectly fine way of doing repeated work, most R programmers prefer not to use loops, but instead use functions such as lapply() and map(). However, for this you will need to know how to write functions. Functions Basic Functions A function is an R object that’s essentially a shortcut to run a bit of code. Usually, a function takes an argument (the input), and returns an output. The argument is always provided within parentheses. The sqrt() function, for example, takes a number as its argument and returns the square root of that number. sqrt(4) ## [1] 2 The beauty of functions is that they allow you to define a set of operations in one place, and re-use it as often as you want. If you then need to update the operations, all you need to do is update the function, instead of hunting down every instance of the operations throughout your script. Take for example the following code that cleans missing data. library(tidyverse) # needed for if_else() #define an example variable variable1 = c(1,2,3,-99,5,6) #change missing variable1_cleaned = if_else(variable1 == -99, NA,variable1) variable1_cleaned ## [1] 1 2 3 NA 5 6 This works, but I need to do this at many different places in my code, and when copying the code to other places, it’s easy to make small mistakes. Moreover, if I notice my procedure for cleaning missing data is wrong, I will have to hunt down all the places I’ve copied this code to, and change it (which, again, is an error prone process). A common piece of advice is to put any code that you have to copy-paste more than twice in a function. Once I do that, I can just call the function wherever I need to clean data; if I want to change how I deal with missings, I now only have to make changes in one place: clean_missing &lt;- function(input_data) { returned_data &lt;- if_else(input_data == -99, NA, input_data) return(returned_data) } I’ve pretty much copied the code I had above. Note that I could have used any name for my argument (defined in the parentheses after function); I just thought input_data made sense. I use the return() function to return data. I can now just use the clean_data() wherever I want: variable1_cleaned &lt;- clean_missing(variable1) variable1_cleaned ## [1] 1 2 3 NA 5 6 Note that any variables we created in the function are kept within the function, and you can’t access them later: variable1_clean &lt;- clean_missing(variable1) returned_data ## Error: object &#39;returned_data&#39; not found This keeps your working environment nice and clean, which again prevents problems. Above I used the return function. This is not needed. Anything on the last line of the function that would normally be returned to the console, is used a return value of the function: clean_missing &lt;- function(input_data) { if_else(input_data == -99, NA, input_data) } clean_missing(variable1) ## [1] 1 2 3 NA 5 6 Functions and the tidyverse In the previous function I passed a vector to clean, what if want to use it in a data cleaning pipe? It’s useful to start with the code without a function, and then to generalize from there: library(tidyverse) data_frame &lt;- tibble(variable1 = variable1) data_frame %&gt;% mutate(variable1 = if_else(variable1 == -99,NA,variable1)) ## # A tibble: 6 × 1 ## variable1 ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 NA ## 5 5 ## 6 6 Let’s try to put that in a function. The function will need to take a data frame and a variable name as its arguments. Results from one step in the pipe, are passed as the first argument for the next step. So make sure the data is the first argument! clean_missing_df &lt;- function(input_dataframe, variablename){ input_dataframe %&gt;% mutate(variablename = if_else(variablename == -99,NA, variablename)) } data_frame %&gt;% clean_missing_df(variable1) ## # A tibble: 6 × 2 ## variable1 variablename ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 ## 2 2 2 ## 3 3 3 ## 4 -99 NA ## 5 5 5 ## 6 6 6 Wait, something went wrong! R just created a new variable called “variablename”. For a technical note on why this is, see here. In short, we want R too look what’s in variablename, not just use it as is. To do so, wrap the variable name in your function definition in {{ and }}, and change the = in mutatate to :=. clean_missing_df &lt;- function(input_dataframe, variablename){ input_dataframe %&gt;% mutate({{ variablename }} := if_else({{ variablename }} == -99, NA, {{ variablename }})) } data_frame %&gt;% clean_missing_df(variable1) ## # A tibble: 6 × 1 ## variable1 ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 NA ## 5 5 ## 6 6 Map() map() works just like loop, but generally faster. It takes two arguments: An iterable object, like a vector or list A function It will then apply the function to each element of the object. It will return a list with the results of each iteration. For example, to get the the square root for each of the numbers in a vector: vector &lt;- c(4,9,16) map(vector,sqrt) ## [[1]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 3 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 4 You may not quite like the fact that map returns a list, but quite a few things in R use lists. modelsummary() for example. Suppose I want to regress the same y on a number of combinations of independent variables, I can put the combination of varaibles in a list, and then run my model for each element of the list. I use reformulate() to convert strings into a formula ‘lm()’ can use. Also, I use ~ to create a purrr-style inline anonymous function within map(). library(modelsummary) # generate some sample data df &lt;- tibble(y = rnorm(50),x1 = rnorm(50),x2 = rnorm(50)) # define a list of models: # the left-hand sides are the labels # the right-hand sides the independent variables I will pass to reformulate. models &lt;- list(&quot;X1 only&quot; = &quot;x1&quot;, &quot;X2 only&quot; = &quot;x2&quot;, &quot;Both&quot; = c(&quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;)) # map() works nicely in dplyr pipe! # the ~ creates a purrr-style anonymous function, where .x is current element of the list models %&gt;% map(~lm(reformulate(.x, response=&quot;y&quot;),data = df)) %&gt;% modelsummary(output = &quot;flextable&quot;) .cl-3a953c30{}.cl-3a8e01a4{font-family:'DejaVu Sans';font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);background-color:transparent;}.cl-3a90c43e{margin:0;text-align:left;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:5pt;padding-top:5pt;padding-left:5pt;padding-right:5pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-3a90e216{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-3a90e220{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-3a90e221{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 1pt solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-3a90e222{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;} X1 onlyX2 onlyBoth(Intercept)-0.206-0.191-0.211(0.163)(0.154)(0.163)x1-0.067-0.069(0.167)(0.167)x20.1510.152(0.162)(0.163)Num.Obs.505050R20.0030.0180.021R2 Adj.-0.017-0.003-0.020AIC155.3154.6156.4BIC161.0160.3164.0Log.Lik.-74.640-74.276-74.185F0.1630.8680.512RMSE1.081.071.07 Making functions re-usable with box Now that you have a bunch of functions, it’s a good idea to make them re-usable across projects. The box package makes this easy. You define your functions in a script, say box_modules/functions.R: prop_miss &lt;- function(x,na.rm = TRUE) { box::use(r/core[...]) mean(is.na(x)) } This is just a function that returns the proportion of missing values in a vector. box::use(r/core[...]) loads all functions from the core package, so you can use them in your function (box modules don’t load anything you don’t tell them to). You can then use this function in any project loading the entire script: box::use(./box_modules/functions) This looks in the folder where your script is located for a folder called box_modules, and loads all functions in the functions.R script. You can run the function by: functions$prop_miss(c(1,2,NA,4)) ## [1] 0.25 Box even allows you to load packages: box::use(dplyr) dplyr$starwars |&gt; dplyr$filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex gender ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none masculi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, blue red 33 none masculi… ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA none masculi… ## 4 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none masculi… ## 5 R4-P17 96 NA none silver, red red, blue NA none feminine ## 6 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none masculi… ## # ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt; In fact, when writing your own box modules, this is the only way to load packages (hence thr box::use(r/core[...] in the function above). Note that you have to use the $ operator to access functions and data from the package or module you loaded. If you dont want that you can also attach specific functions: box::use(dplyr[filter, `%&gt;%`]) dplyr$starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex gender ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none masculi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, blue red 33 none masculi… ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA none masculi… ## 4 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none masculi… ## 5 R4-P17 96 NA none silver, red red, blue NA none feminine ## 6 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none masculi… ## # ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt; Or just attach everything just like you would with library(): box::use(dplyr[...]) starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Droid&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex gender ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none masculi… ## 2 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, blue red 33 none masculi… ## 3 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA none masculi… ## 4 IG-88 200 140 none metal red 15 none masculi… ## 5 R4-P17 96 NA none silver, red red, blue NA none feminine ## 6 BB8 NA NA none none black NA none masculi… ## # ℹ 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt; Alright, let’s unload our own function, so we can load it in another way, using: box::unload(functions) Alternatively, you can specify a search path, where box will look for modules. I will put my box modules in C:/Users/koen/documents/box_modules. The following code will allow box to look in that folder for modules: options(&#39;box.path&#39; = &quot;C:/Users/koen/documents/&quot;) # &lt;-- the parent folder!! Note that I have used the parent folder of box_modules, because for whatever reason you have to do that (the .R files need to be in a subfolder). By adding this to your [.Rprofile](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/environments/r/managing-r.html) file, it will be run any time you open R. Now I can just use the following code in any project to access my functions: box::use(box_modules/functions) functions$prop_miss(c(1,2,NA,4,5,NA)) ## [1] 0.3333333 Of course you are no longer working project-oriented: your box modules aren’t in your project folder! If you want to use box modules within your project folder, best to add the root folder as search path: options(&#39;box.path&#39; = h c(here::here(), getOption(&#39;box.path&#39;)) The function getOption('box.path') gets your current box search path, and c() combines it with your project root folder returned by here(). One way I like to organize my box modules is to have them in a git repository and use it as a submodule in my projects. That way you can have a specific version or branch of all your box modules in every project. You can also merge changes you make to you box modules of one project, back to all your other active projects. It’s fantastic, but a bit finnicky to set up.

So for every project, you’ll likely do a substantial amount of data wrangling. The goal of reproducible data wrangling is that at any moment, you can re-run your code to go from raw data to outputs. This is only useful, if you organize and document your code in such a way that people unfamiliar with the project (this could be future you!) can understand and modify the code. For this, RMarkdown is great, as it contains code, results and documentation all in one place. This chapter will provide examples of common data wrangling patterns, as well as how they can fit it into a reproducible data cleaning RMarkdown file. Make sure you have the tidyverse installed, and the SAFI data set downloaded to your data folder by running the code from the Set-up section The basic pattern Below is an example R Script, with some common data wrangling tasks, organized as follows: Loading raw data Cleaning data using dplyr, including filtering, mutating and changing factor levels. Saving cleaned data, so it can be used in analysis scripts. Note that objects are never overwritten: data is loaded as raw_data, and once manipulated, saved as clean_data. This helps avoid mistakes where you accidentally use partially cleaned data further down the script, and makes going back to previous versions easier. # loading packages library(tidyverse) library(here) # loading raw data raw_data &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) # data cleaning clean_data &lt;- raw_data %&gt;% filter(village == &quot;Chirodzo&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(people_per_room = no_membrs / rooms, years_liv = if_else(years_liv &gt; 90, NA, years_liv), respondent_wall_type = as_factor(respondent_wall_type), respondent_wall_type = fct_recode(respondent_wall_type, &quot;Burned bricks&quot; = &quot;burntbricks&quot;, &quot;Mud Daub&quot; = &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;Sun bricks&quot; = &quot;sunbricks&quot;), conflict_yn = case_when(affect_conflicts == &quot;frequently&quot; ~ 1, affect_conflicts == &quot;more_once&quot; ~ 1, affect_conflicts == &quot;once&quot; ~ 1, affect_conflicts == &quot;never&quot; ~ 0, .default = NA), day = day(interview_date), month = month(interview_date), year = year(interview_date)) %&gt;% select(key_ID:rooms, day:people_per_room, -village) %&gt;% filter(interview_date &gt; &quot;2016-11-16&quot; &amp; interview_date &lt; &#39;2017-01-01&#39;) # saving clean data for later use clean_data %&gt;% saveRDS(here(&quot;data/SAFI_cleaner.rds&quot;)) Throughout this chapter, we will add things to this sctructure, until we end up with a basic .Rmd file that is easy to work with. First we will info on how to include plots, then how to use multi-level data, and finally some advanced techniques such as editing multiple varaibles all at once. Using plots to identify data issues reproducibly A key part of data cleaning is identifying issues in the data. This is often done by plotting the data, inspecting summary statistics, or tabulating values. In R, this is easy to do in a reproducible way using ggplot2. For example, to identify outliers in the years_liv variable, we can make a boxplot: raw_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = years_liv)) + geom_boxplot() From the boxplot, we can see that there’s no super unplausible numbers. But let’s say we are worried, and want to winsorize this variable at 95%, just so that the few high values don’t affect our analysis too much. years_liv_clean &lt;- raw_data %&gt;% select(key_ID, years_liv) %&gt;% mutate(years_liv = if_else(years_liv &gt; quantile(years_liv, 0.95, na.rm=TRUE), quantile(years_liv, 0.95, na.rm=TRUE), years_liv)) I’ve saved the cleaned variable as a new object, so I don’t overwrite anything. In the final .Rmd file, I will merge this back into the cleaned data. This way, my cleaned data only contains data I expicitly select. This keeps useless clutters to a minimum, making my analysis data file easy to understand for my co-workers. This pattern is quite common: plot data identify issues and outliers, and describe them in rmarkdown clean data merge cleanded data back in data Dealing with multiple levels of data In many surveys, data is collected at multiple levels, for example the village, household, and individual level, with each level having its own data set. For analysis purposes these data sets often need to be merged together. First, let’s make sure our dataset has multiple levels, by generating some fake individual-level data, making sure that the household roster has a number of lines for each household that is equal to the household size, and has two randomly generated variables: female and age. Note that age may be -99, which should be considered missing. long_data &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% select(key_ID,no_membrs ) %&gt;% uncount(no_membrs) %&gt;% group_by(key_ID) %&gt;% mutate(member_ID = row_number()) %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(female = sample(0:1,1), age = case_when(member_ID == 1 ~ sample(18:86,1), .default = sample(c(0:86,-99),1))) %&gt;% ungroup() long_data %&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 942 ## Columns: 4 ## $ key_ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, … ## $ member_ID &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,… ## $ female &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, … ## $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 77, 72, 83, 86, 73, 10, 75, 63, 51, 70, 41, 72, 0, 85, 77, 5… # I save the data as a CSV long_data %&gt;% write_csv(here(&quot;data/rawSAFI_roster.csv&quot;)) Pivoting long to wide To merge this roster data to our household data, we need to make sure we have one row per household. We do this by making age and female variables for each household member (age_1, age_2, etc.), For this, we use the pivot_wider() function (in Stata this would be called reshaping ). wide_data &lt;- long_data %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = member_ID, values_from = !ends_with(&quot;_ID&quot;), names_vary = &quot;slowest&quot;) wide_data %&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 131 ## Columns: 39 ## $ key_ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 1… ## $ female_1 &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, … ## $ age_1 &lt;dbl&gt; 77, 86, 41, 69, 25, 44, 23, 63, 28, 56, 78, 47, 23, 71, 60, … ## $ female_2 &lt;int&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, … ## $ age_2 &lt;dbl&gt; 72, 73, 72, 25, 17, 37, 8, 57, 64, 60, 45, 3, 31, 40, 36, 26… ## $ female_3 &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, … ## $ age_3 &lt;dbl&gt; 83, 10, 0, 49, 22, 13, 5, 14, 39, 5, 16, 17, 79, 47, 0, 3, 2… ## $ female_4 &lt;int&gt; NA, 1, 0, 0, 1, NA, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0… ## $ age_4 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 75, 85, 30, 62, NA, 60, 44, 28, 77, 78, 18, 13, 77, 45, … ## $ female_5 &lt;int&gt; NA, 1, 0, 1, 0, NA, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, NA, 1, … ## $ age_5 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 63, 77, 81, 5, NA, 58, 55, 4, 45, 20, 81, 7, 78, 6, 76, … ## $ female_6 &lt;int&gt; NA, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, NA, 0, 1, NA, 0,… ## $ age_6 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 51, 51, 8, 33, NA, 4, 80, 42, 5, 73, 23, 11, 54, NA, 78,… ## $ female_7 &lt;int&gt; NA, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, 1, NA, 1, NA, 0, NA, NA, 1, NA… ## $ age_7 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 70, 27, 84, 48, NA, NA, 65, 34, 50, NA, 56, NA, 65, NA, … ## $ female_8 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, 1, 0, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, 1… ## $ age_8 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, 85, NA, NA, NA, NA, 54, 6, 55, NA, NA, NA, 54, NA, N… ## $ female_9 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, … ## $ age_9 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, 56, NA, NA, NA, NA, 18, NA, 26, NA, NA, NA, 9, NA, N… ## $ female_10 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, … ## $ age_10 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, 81, NA, NA, NA, NA, 22, NA, 14, NA, NA, NA, 20, NA, … ## $ female_11 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA… ## $ age_11 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 40, NA, 61, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_12 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA… ## $ age_12 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 53, NA, 18, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_13 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_13 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_14 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_14 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_15 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_15 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_16 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_16 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_17 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_17 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_18 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_18 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ female_19 &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … ## $ age_19 &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, … We only needed to specify three options: names_from: this is the column that contains the names (or often numbers) for each of our units of analysis. In this case, the member_ID. The values of this variable will be appended to the original variable names to create new variable names. So age becomes age_1, age_2, etc. values_from: the variables containing the data. All variables you specify here, will get one column for each possible value of names_from. In our case, these variables female and age. I used tidy select syntax to specify all variables except the ones ending in _ID. names_vary: this controls the ordering of the variables. By default (“fastest”), R will create all age variables, and then all female variables, by specifying slowest, we ensure that first all variables for member 1 are created, then all variables for member 2, etc. Pivoting wide to long If we had started with wide data, and had wanted to transform to long data, we’d have to use pivot_longer(): wide_data %&gt;% pivot_longer(!key_ID, names_to = &quot;name&quot;, values_to = &quot;value&quot;) %&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 4,978 ## Columns: 3 ## $ key_ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, … ## $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;female_1&quot;, &quot;age_1&quot;, &quot;female_2&quot;, &quot;age_2&quot;, &quot;female_3&quot;, &quot;age_3&quot;, … ## $ value &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 77, 1, 72, 0, 83, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA… This was easy since the syntax of pivot_longer() is the exact opposite of pivot_wider(), but the result is pretty useless: The name column contains two things: a variable name and a member_ID; The data is too long: I’d like age and female to be two separate variables; and There’s many empty rows: there’s an age and female row for 19 possible members for each household, but most households are smaller than that. I could use separate_wider_delim(), pivot_wider(), and filter(!is.na()) to address those, but that’s not elegant at all. I can do all of this within the pivot_longer() call by using the names_to and names_sep options: wide_data %&gt;% pivot_longer(!key_ID, names_to = c(&quot;.value&quot;, &quot;member_ID&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_drop_na = TRUE, names_transform = list(member_ID = as.integer)) ## # A tibble: 942 × 4 ## key_ID member_ID female age ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 1 77 ## 2 1 2 1 72 ## 3 1 3 0 83 ## 4 2 1 1 86 ## 5 2 2 0 73 ## 6 2 3 1 10 ## 7 2 4 1 75 ## 8 2 5 1 63 ## 9 2 6 1 51 ## 10 2 7 1 70 ## # ℹ 932 more rows In this case, the syntax is a bit harder to understand. It’s good to think first what the original data looks like, and how I intend to transform it. The wide data has columns key_ID, age_1-19 and female_1-19. I don’t really want to touch the key_ID column. I want to turn the columns age_1-19 and female_1-19 into three columns: female, age and member_ID. This translates to the options we passed to pivot_longer() as follows: !key_ID: We want to pivot the data that’s in all columns except key_ID. names_to = c(\".value\", \"member_ID\"): this specifies the new columns we want to create. It basically says that the existing column names consist of two parts: one part (i.e. female and age) that we wish to keep as column names of variables that will contain my values, and one part (i.e. the numbers 1-19) which should be put into a new column which we will “member_ID”. names_sep=: this indicates how the two parts mentioned above are separated. In more difficult cases, you’ll have to use the names_pattern option. This requires some knowledge of regular expressions, so here’s two examples: If there is no seperator (age1,female1 etc…): names_pattern = \"(.*\\\\D)([0-9]+)$\". In this regular expression, .*\\\\D matches a string of any length, of any characters, as long as it ends with something other than a digit. The [0-9]+$ matches any number of digits at the end of the string. The parentheses indicate how the string should be separated to form variable names and member_ID. If the separator is used in other places in variable names (member_age_1 etc…): names_pattern = \"(.*)_([0-9]+)$\". values_drop_na = TRUE: tells R to drop rows that have missing data for all variables. This prevents the issue where we hadd too many rows. names_transform: by default, all name columns will be character types, but member_ID only contains integers, so we transform it to integer. This is completely optional. Joining (or merging) data Tidyverse has four functions to join (or merge, as Stata calls it) two data sets. The functions that differ in the way they treat observations that are in one data set but not the other. Consider the diagram below. It has two data sets, x (in Stata terms, this is the master data set) and y (the using data set in Stata terms). They have overlapping rows (area B), but also rows that are only in x (area A) or only in y (area C). The four join functions work as follows: inner_join(x,y) will only keep area B. left_join(x,y) will keep areas A and B. right_join(x,y) will keep areas B and C. full_join(x,y) will keep areas A, B, and C. There’s also filtering joins: - `semi_join(x,y)` will only keep area B, but won&#39;t add columns to X - `anti_join(x,y)`, will only keep area A, and won&#39;t add columns to X. In our case, the data sets match perfectly, i.e. we only have an area B, so there is no practical difference between the four regular joins. I chose left_join() so the number of observations in my household survey is guaranteed to remain the same. To merge the roster to the household data, we use the join_by function: read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% left_join(wide_data) ## Rows: 131 Columns: 14 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (7): village, respondent_wall_type, memb_assoc, affect_conflicts, items... ## dbl (6): key_ID, no_membrs, years_liv, rooms, liv_count, no_meals ## dttm (1): interview_date ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. ## Joining with `by = join_by(key_ID)` ## # A tibble: 131 × 52 ## key_ID village interview_date no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 3 4 muddaub ## 2 2 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 7 9 muddaub ## 3 3 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 10 15 burntbricks ## 4 4 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 7 6 burntbricks ## 5 5 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 7 40 burntbricks ## 6 6 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 3 3 muddaub ## 7 7 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 6 38 muddaub ## 8 8 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00 12 70 burntbricks ## 9 9 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00 8 6 burntbricks ## 10 10 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00 12 23 burntbricks ## # ℹ 121 more rows ## # ℹ 46 more variables: rooms &lt;dbl&gt;, memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt;, affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt;, ## # liv_count &lt;dbl&gt;, items_owned &lt;chr&gt;, no_meals &lt;dbl&gt;, months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt;, ## # instanceID &lt;chr&gt;, female_1 &lt;int&gt;, age_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_2 &lt;int&gt;, age_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_3 &lt;int&gt;, age_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_4 &lt;int&gt;, age_4 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_5 &lt;int&gt;, ## # age_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_6 &lt;int&gt;, age_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_7 &lt;int&gt;, age_7 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_8 &lt;int&gt;, age_8 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_9 &lt;int&gt;, age_9 &lt;dbl&gt;, … Note that we didn’t specify identifiers, like we would in Stata. R assumed that the variables that appear in both data frames are the identifiers, in this case key_ID. Use the by option to change this. Going the other way around, joining the household data to the roster data, is equally easy: long_data %&gt;% left_join( read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% select(key_ID,village,interview_date)) ## Rows: 131 Columns: 14 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (7): village, respondent_wall_type, memb_assoc, affect_conflicts, items... ## dbl (6): key_ID, no_membrs, years_liv, rooms, liv_count, no_meals ## dttm (1): interview_date ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. ## Joining with `by = join_by(key_ID)` ## # A tibble: 942 × 6 ## key_ID member_ID female age village interview_date ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; ## 1 1 1 1 77 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 2 1 2 1 72 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 3 1 3 0 83 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 4 2 1 1 86 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 5 2 2 0 73 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 6 2 3 1 10 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 7 2 4 1 75 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 8 2 5 1 63 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 9 2 6 1 51 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## 10 2 7 1 70 God 2016-11-17 00:00:00 ## # ℹ 932 more rows Note that here I only merged in two variables, by using select and a pipe within the left_join() function. Summarizing over groups (or collapsing data) Another way to transform individual-level data to household-level data is to compute summary statistics (sums, counts, means etc.). For this, we use the group_by() and summarize() functions. For example, to compute the household size, number of women and average age in each household. But before doing anything, I make sure the -99s in the age variable are treated as missing, using a simple mutate() to conver them to NA. long_data %&gt;% group_by(key_ID) %&gt;% mutate(age = if_else(age == -99,NA,age)) %&gt;% summarize(hh_size = n(), num_women = sum(female), mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 131 × 4 ## key_ID hh_size num_women mean_age ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 3 2 77.3 ## 2 2 7 6 61.1 ## 3 3 10 0 57.5 ## 4 4 7 1 49.4 ## 5 5 7 4 30.3 ## 6 6 3 2 31.3 ## 7 7 6 4 26.3 ## 8 8 12 6 47.1 ## 9 9 8 4 30.6 ## 10 10 12 8 39.3 ## # ℹ 121 more rows Editing many variables at once Often, you’ll to do the same operation to many variables. For example, recoding missing values. While you can copy paste the code for each variable, this may lead to errors (if you forget to change the variable name somewhere), and is tedious to maintain (if you need to change something later on. So, it’s better to do this in a programmatic way. Here’s some pointers: across(): doing the same operations on multiple variables using across The main function to do this is across(), which is used within mutate() or summarize(). For example, we need to make sure we update -99 to NA in all age_ variables in our wide data. We could write this: wide_data %&gt;% mutate(age_1 = if_else(age_1 == -99,NA,age_1), age_2 = if_else(age_2 == -99,NA,age_2), age_3 = if_else(age_3 == -99,NA,age_3), age_4 = if_else(age_4 == -99,NA,age_4), age_5 = if_else(age_5 == -99,NA,age_5), age_6 = if_else(age_6 == -99,NA,age_6), age_7 = if_else(age_7 == -99,NA,age_7), age_8 = if_else(age_8 == -99,NA,age_8), age_9 = if_else(age_9 == -99,NA,age_9), age_10 = if_else(age_10 == -99,NA,age_10), age_11 = if_else(age_11 == -99,NA,age_11), age_12 = if_else(age_12 == -99,NA,age_12), age_13 = if_else(age_13 == -99,NA,age_13), age_14 = if_else(age_14 == -99,NA,age_14), age_15 = if_else(age_15 == -99,NA,age_15), age_16 = if_else(age_16 == -99,NA,age_16), age_17 = if_else(age_17 == -99,NA,age_17), age_18 = if_else(age_18 == -99,NA,age_18), age_19 = if_else(age_19 == -99,NA,age_19) ) ## # A tibble: 131 × 39 ## key_ID female_1 age_1 female_2 age_2 female_3 age_3 female_4 age_4 female_5 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 1 77 1 72 0 83 NA NA NA ## 2 2 1 86 0 73 1 10 1 75 1 ## 3 3 0 41 0 72 0 0 0 85 0 ## 4 4 0 69 0 25 0 49 0 30 1 ## 5 5 1 25 1 17 1 22 1 62 0 ## 6 6 1 44 1 37 0 13 NA NA NA ## 7 7 0 23 1 8 0 5 1 60 1 ## 8 8 1 63 1 57 0 14 0 44 1 ## 9 9 1 28 0 64 0 39 1 28 0 ## 10 10 1 56 0 60 1 5 1 77 0 ## # ℹ 121 more rows ## # ℹ 29 more variables: age_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_6 &lt;int&gt;, age_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_7 &lt;int&gt;, age_7 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_8 &lt;int&gt;, age_8 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_9 &lt;int&gt;, ## # age_9 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_10 &lt;int&gt;, age_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_11 &lt;int&gt;, age_11 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_12 &lt;int&gt;, age_12 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_13 &lt;int&gt;, age_13 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_14 &lt;int&gt;, age_14 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_15 &lt;int&gt;, age_15 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_16 &lt;int&gt;, age_16 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_17 &lt;int&gt;, age_17 &lt;dbl&gt;, … However, this is extremely tedious and error-prone (though AI makes this easier nowadays!), and makes your code unreusable, as it depends on the highest number of members in your data set to be exactly 19. If you have households with 20 members, or no household with more than 10, you’d have to change this code. Instead, I use the across() function, which takes two arguments: a column specifcation (for which I use tidy select syntax), and a function. It will then apply the function to all columns: cleanmissing &lt;- function(x) { if_else(x == -99, NA, x) } wide_data %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;), .fns = cleanmissing)) ## # A tibble: 131 × 39 ## key_ID female_1 age_1 female_2 age_2 female_3 age_3 female_4 age_4 female_5 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 1 77 1 72 0 83 NA NA NA ## 2 2 1 86 0 73 1 10 1 75 1 ## 3 3 0 41 0 72 0 0 0 85 0 ## 4 4 0 69 0 25 0 49 0 30 1 ## 5 5 1 25 1 17 1 22 1 62 0 ## 6 6 1 44 1 37 0 13 NA NA NA ## 7 7 0 23 1 8 0 5 1 60 1 ## 8 8 1 63 1 57 0 14 0 44 1 ## 9 9 1 28 0 64 0 39 1 28 0 ## 10 10 1 56 0 60 1 5 1 77 0 ## # ℹ 121 more rows ## # ℹ 29 more variables: age_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_6 &lt;int&gt;, age_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_7 &lt;int&gt;, age_7 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_8 &lt;int&gt;, age_8 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_9 &lt;int&gt;, ## # age_9 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_10 &lt;int&gt;, age_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_11 &lt;int&gt;, age_11 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_12 &lt;int&gt;, age_12 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_13 &lt;int&gt;, age_13 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_14 &lt;int&gt;, age_14 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_15 &lt;int&gt;, age_15 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_16 &lt;int&gt;, age_16 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_17 &lt;int&gt;, age_17 &lt;dbl&gt;, … We can have variables for 100 household members, and this code will still work! Notes: You can use across(.cols = where(is.numeric), .fn = ...) to apply a function to all numeric variables. You can also combine across() with summarize() to summarize multiple variables more easily. See the section on faceting for an example. You can also define the function in line, if you don’t plan on using the function anywhere else: wide_data %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;), .fns = function(var) if_else(var == -99,NA, var))) ## # A tibble: 131 × 39 ## key_ID female_1 age_1 female_2 age_2 female_3 age_3 female_4 age_4 female_5 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 1 77 1 72 0 83 NA NA NA ## 2 2 1 86 0 73 1 10 1 75 1 ## 3 3 0 41 0 72 0 0 0 85 0 ## 4 4 0 69 0 25 0 49 0 30 1 ## 5 5 1 25 1 17 1 22 1 62 0 ## 6 6 1 44 1 37 0 13 NA NA NA ## 7 7 0 23 1 8 0 5 1 60 1 ## 8 8 1 63 1 57 0 14 0 44 1 ## 9 9 1 28 0 64 0 39 1 28 0 ## 10 10 1 56 0 60 1 5 1 77 0 ## # ℹ 121 more rows ## # ℹ 29 more variables: age_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_6 &lt;int&gt;, age_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_7 &lt;int&gt;, age_7 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_8 &lt;int&gt;, age_8 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_9 &lt;int&gt;, ## # age_9 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_10 &lt;int&gt;, age_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_11 &lt;int&gt;, age_11 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_12 &lt;int&gt;, age_12 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_13 &lt;int&gt;, age_13 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_14 &lt;int&gt;, age_14 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_15 &lt;int&gt;, age_15 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # female_16 &lt;int&gt;, age_16 &lt;dbl&gt;, female_17 &lt;int&gt;, age_17 &lt;dbl&gt;, … Note that throughout this page, I will use different ways of defining these inline functions. They all work, so pick what you like and be consistent. Pivoting Of course, in the example above, it would have been possible to pivot the data to long first, so that we have one age variable, and no need to use across. wide_data %&gt;% pivot_longer(!key_ID, names_to = c(&quot;.value&quot;, &quot;member_ID&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_drop_na = TRUE, names_transform = list(member_ID = as.integer)) %&gt;% mutate(age = if_else(age == -99,NA,age))) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = member_ID, values_from = !ends_with(&quot;_ID&quot;), names_vary = &quot;slowest&quot;) ## Error in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:8:45: unexpected &#39;)&#39; ## 7: names_transform = list(member_ID = as.integer)) %&gt;% ## 8: mutate(age = if_else(age == -99,NA,age))) ## ^ This is a bit more work, but often more flexible, and the more operations you need to do, the more worthwhile it is to pivot to long first. The pivoting approach can also be useful even if you don’t really have another level of analysis, but just repeated questions. Let’s say we have a bunch of related variables, such as expenditures on input: expenditures_raw &lt;- wide_data %&gt;% select(key_ID) %&gt;% # generate some repeated questions mutate(expenditures_fertilizer = rnorm(n = nrow(.)), expenditures_seeds = rnorm(n = nrow(.)), expenditures_tools = rnorm(n = nrow(.))) These variabes all contain the same type of information, and should be dealth with in the same way. We could plot and clean each variable separately, but by pivoting we can do it one go, since ggplot2 expects long data. expenditures_long &lt;- expenditures_raw %&gt;% #pivot pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(&quot;expenditures_&quot;), names_to = &quot;expenditure_type&quot;, values_to = &quot;amount&quot;) expenditures_long %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = expenditure_type, y = amount)) + geom_boxplot() Following the pattern of plotting, documenting and cleaning, we notice negative values of expenditures here. That’s not possible, so I set them to 0 (though in the real world I’d have to argue why not NA): expenditures_cleaned &lt;- expenditures_long %&gt;% mutate(amount = if_else(amount &lt; 0, 0, amount)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = expenditure_type, values_from = amount) Now you have a dataframe with a bunch of variables, ready to be merged in with the rest. Using many variables as inputs Suppose we wanted to use many variables as input for a calculation. For example to get the household size, number of women and average age from our wide data. The easiest, and probably best, way to do this in R is by reshaping to long, and then use summarize, like we did above. But in Stata you would probably use some sort of egen function, so that may come natural. You can do similar things in R. It’s just a bit more complex than in Stata. To compute means and sums across rows, use rowSums() and rowMeans(): wide_data %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;), .fn = ~if_else(.x == -99,NA,.x))) %&gt;% mutate(mean_age = rowMeans(across(starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;)), na.rm=TRUE), num_women = rowSums(across(starts_with(&quot;female_&quot;)), na.rm=TRUE), hh_size = rowSums(!is.na(across(starts_with(&quot;female_&quot;))))) %&gt;% select(key_ID,hh_size,num_women, mean_age) %&gt;% ungroup() ## # A tibble: 131 × 4 ## key_ID hh_size num_women mean_age ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 3 2 77.3 ## 2 2 7 6 61.1 ## 3 3 10 0 57.5 ## 4 4 7 1 49.4 ## 5 5 7 4 30.3 ## 6 6 3 2 31.3 ## 7 7 6 4 26.3 ## 8 8 12 6 47.1 ## 9 9 8 4 30.6 ## 10 10 12 8 39.3 ## # ℹ 121 more rows If you want to compute something other than means or sums, you can use c_across() to get a bunch of variables into any function you want: wide_data %&gt;% mutate(across(.cols = starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;), .fn = ~if_else(.x == -99,NA,.x))) %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(max_age = max(c_across(starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;)), na.rm=TRUE), sd_age = sd(c_across(starts_with(&quot;age_&quot;)), na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% select(key_ID,max_age,sd_age) %&gt;% ungroup() ## # A tibble: 131 × 3 ## key_ID max_age sd_age ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 83 5.51 ## 2 2 86 25.0 ## 3 3 85 28.3 ## 4 4 84 29.6 ## 5 5 62 19.3 ## 6 6 44 16.3 ## 7 7 60 26.2 ## 8 8 80 20.3 ## 9 9 64 19.5 ## 10 10 77 24.5 ## # ℹ 121 more rows The key trick here is the combination of rowwise() and c_across(). rowwise() ensures all summaries are computed per row, and c_across() allows you to use tidy select syntax within any function. Do note that while this is very flexible, it can be EXTREMLY slow. If you have a large dataset, it’s probably faster to pivot the data to long first. Renaming many variables Let’s say we need to rename a bunch of variables. One way is to use a named list: # this follows the pattern new_name = old_name newnames &lt;- c(&quot;no_livestock&quot; = &quot;liv_count&quot;, &quot;no_rooms&quot; = &quot;rooms&quot;, &quot;affect_conflicts&quot; = &quot;ffect_conflicts&quot;) read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% rename(any_of(newnames)) %&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 131 ## Columns: 14 ## $ key_ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15… ## $ village &lt;chr&gt; &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, … ## $ interview_date &lt;dttm&gt; 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, … ## $ no_membrs &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 7, 10, 7, 7, 3, 6, 12, 8, 12, 6, 7, 6, 10, 5, … ## $ years_liv &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 9, 15, 6, 40, 3, 38, 70, 6, 23, 20, 20, 8, 20,… ## $ respondent_wall_type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;burntbricks&quot;, &quot;burntbricks… ## $ no_rooms &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1… ## $ memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt; NA, &quot;yes&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no… ## $ affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt; NA, &quot;once&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;ne… ## $ no_livestock &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1… ## $ items_owned &lt;chr&gt; &quot;bicycle;television;solar_panel;table&quot;, &quot;cow_cart… ## $ no_meals &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2… ## $ months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Jan;Sept;Oct;Nov;Dec&quot;, &quot;Jan;Feb;Mar;Oct;N… ## $ instanceID &lt;chr&gt; &quot;uuid:ec241f2c-0609-46ed-b5e8-fe575f6cefef&quot;, &quot;uui… Note that \"affect_conflicts\" = \"ffect_conflicts\" didn’t do anything, as there is no ffect_conflicts variable. any_of() just ignored any variables not present in the data. This can be useful in data pipelines using multiple files, where some files have mistyped variable names. What if we want to do the same thing to many variables? For example, turning them all to uppercase? We could use newnames = c(KEY_ID = key_ID, VILLAGE = village) etc. etc., but that’d be extremely tedious. Instead, there is rename_with(), which takes two arugments: .fn: A function that takes the variable names of your dataset as an argument. .cols: a tidy select statement defining which columns to change. Defaults to all columns. This is what it’d look like: read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% rename_with(.fn = toupper) %&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 131 ## Columns: 14 ## $ KEY_ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15… ## $ VILLAGE &lt;chr&gt; &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, … ## $ INTERVIEW_DATE &lt;dttm&gt; 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, … ## $ NO_MEMBRS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 7, 10, 7, 7, 3, 6, 12, 8, 12, 6, 7, 6, 10, 5, … ## $ YEARS_LIV &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 9, 15, 6, 40, 3, 38, 70, 6, 23, 20, 20, 8, 20,… ## $ RESPONDENT_WALL_TYPE &lt;chr&gt; &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;burntbricks&quot;, &quot;burntbricks… ## $ ROOMS &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1… ## $ MEMB_ASSOC &lt;chr&gt; NA, &quot;yes&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no… ## $ AFFECT_CONFLICTS &lt;chr&gt; NA, &quot;once&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;ne… ## $ LIV_COUNT &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1… ## $ ITEMS_OWNED &lt;chr&gt; &quot;bicycle;television;solar_panel;table&quot;, &quot;cow_cart… ## $ NO_MEALS &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2… ## $ MONTHS_LACK_FOOD &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Jan;Sept;Oct;Nov;Dec&quot;, &quot;Jan;Feb;Mar;Oct;N… ## $ INSTANCEID &lt;chr&gt; &quot;uuid:ec241f2c-0609-46ed-b5e8-fe575f6cefef&quot;, &quot;uui… The variables names are used as the argument to toupper(), which returns them in upper case. But what if we need to provide more arguments? Let’s say we want to append _0 to all columns, except the ID columns, to indicate this is baseline data.

(This all works the same as across() above.) Now, let’s replace all instances of membrs or memb in variable names with members (so no_membrs becomes no_members, and memb_assoc becomes members_assoc. For this I will use gsub(), which takes three arguments: A pattern (expressed as a regular expression) to look for; a replacement for all matches of the pattern; and, the data to look in (in this case the varaible names). read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% rename_with(.fn = ~gsub(&quot;membrs|memb&quot;, &quot;members&quot;,.x)) %&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 131 ## Columns: 14 ## $ key_ID &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15… ## $ village &lt;chr&gt; &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, … ## $ interview_date &lt;dttm&gt; 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, 2016-11-17, … ## $ no_members &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 7, 10, 7, 7, 3, 6, 12, 8, 12, 6, 7, 6, 10, 5, … ## $ years_liv &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 9, 15, 6, 40, 3, 38, 70, 6, 23, 20, 20, 8, 20,… ## $ respondent_wall_type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;muddaub&quot;, &quot;burntbricks&quot;, &quot;burntbricks… ## $ rooms &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1… ## $ members_assoc &lt;chr&gt; NA, &quot;yes&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no… ## $ affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt; NA, &quot;once&quot;, NA, NA, NA, NA, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;ne… ## $ liv_count &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1… ## $ items_owned &lt;chr&gt; &quot;bicycle;television;solar_panel;table&quot;, &quot;cow_cart… ## $ no_meals &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2… ## $ months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Jan;Sept;Oct;Nov;Dec&quot;, &quot;Jan;Feb;Mar;Oct;N… ## $ instanceID &lt;chr&gt; &quot;uuid:ec241f2c-0609-46ed-b5e8-fe575f6cefef&quot;, &quot;uui… Splitting multi-response variable into dummies The SAFI data contains a number of columns that contain all responses selected in a multiple response questions. For example, the variables items_owned can contain something like \"bicycle;television;solar_panel;table\". We want to split this into dummies: one for each possible answers. There’s a number of ways to do this, but the most convenient is using separate_longer() read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% separate_longer_delim(items_owned, delim = &quot;;&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(value = 1) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned, values_from = value, names_glue = &quot;owns_{items_owned}&quot;, values_fill = 0) %&gt;% left_join( read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% select(key_ID,items_owned)) %&gt;% select(items_owned, starts_with(&quot;owns_&quot;) ) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 × 19 ## items_owned owns_bicycle owns_television owns_solar_panel owns_table ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 bicycle;television;s… 1 1 1 1 ## 2 cow_cart;bicycle;rad… 1 0 1 1 ## 3 solar_torch 0 0 0 0 ## 4 bicycle;radio;cow_pl… 1 0 1 0 ## 5 motorcyle;radio;cow_… 0 0 0 0 ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; 0 0 0 0 ## # ℹ 14 more variables: owns_cow_cart &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_radio &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # owns_cow_plough &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_solar_torch &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_mobile_phone &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # owns_motorcyle &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_NA &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_fridge &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # owns_electricity &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_sofa_set &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_lorry &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # owns_sterio &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_computer &lt;dbl&gt;, owns_car &lt;dbl&gt; Note that the original items_owned variable is lost during the separate_longer_delim() step, so I used left_join() to merge it back in for demonstration purposes. Structure of a cleaning Rmarkdown doc with multi-level data In a script, I would typically deal with each level separately, and then merge them together at the end: --- title: &quot;Example Data Wrangling RMarkdown&quot; output: html_document --- # introduction This is an example of a data cleaning RMarkdown script for multi-level data (household and individual level).

I will create a table of descriptive statistics, and a simple regression table. Generating some fake data First we make a fake intervention aimed at improving fertilizer adoption.

To convert them to word, I use the flextable package. For a simple table of descriptive statistics, use the datasummary() function. I also define a vector with variable labels, which I use throughout this chapter. Below, I use it in the labelizor() function, which applies labels to a flextable object. I also apply the autofit() and fix_border_issues() functions to make the table look nicer. library(modelsummary) library(flextable) # vector for labelling variable names labels = c(no_membrs = &quot;#

First, make a data frame with summary statistics. I duplicate the data set using bind_rows() to create an overall group. Then I use summarize(across(...)) to apply summarizing functionsto a number of variables. summstats &lt;- bind_rows(data %&gt;% mutate(Treatment = ifelse(treatment, &quot; Treatment&quot;, &quot; Control&quot;)), data %&gt;% mutate(Treatment = &quot;Overall&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment)) %&gt;% select(where(is.numeric),Treatment,-key_ID,-treatment) %&gt;% group_by(Treatment) %&gt;% summarize(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = list(n = ~sum(!is.na(.x)), nmiss = ~sum(is.na(.x)), mean = ~mean(.x,na.rm=TRUE), sd = ~sd(.x,na.rm=TRUE), min = ~min(.x,na.rm=TRUE), max = ~max(.x,na.rm=TRUE), iqr = ~IQR(.x,na.rm=TRUE)), .names = &quot;{.col}-{.fn}&quot;)) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -Treatment, names_to = c(&quot;Variable&quot;,&quot;.value&quot;), names_sep=&quot;-&quot;) summstats ## # A tibble: 21 × 9 ## Treatment Variable n nmiss mean sd min max iqr ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 &quot; Control&quot; no_membrs 82 0 6.96 2.86 2 15 3.75 ## 2 &quot; Control&quot; years_liv 82 0 21.9 14.9 1 70 13.8 ## 3 &quot; Control&quot; rooms 82 0 1.74 1.17 1 8 1 ## 4 &quot; Control&quot; liv_count 82 0 2.24 1.01 1 4 2 ## 5 &quot; Control&quot; no_meals 82 0 2.59 0.496 2 3 1 ## 6 &quot; Control&quot; educated 82 0 0.293 0.458 0 1 1 ## 7 &quot; Control&quot; uses_fertilizer 82 0 0.244 0.432 0 1 0 ## 8 &quot; Treatment&quot; no_membrs 49 0 7.57 3.64 2 19 5 ## 9 &quot; Treatment&quot; years_liv 49 0 24.9 19.8 2 96 22 ## 10 &quot; Treatment&quot; rooms 49 0 1.73 0.953 1 4 1 ## # ℹ 11 more rows Then use I flextable’s tabulator() to make output that looks good in word. Note that tabulator() sorts the columns alphabetically, so that would be control - overall - treatment. That doesn’t make sense, so I have used spaces (\" Treatment\") to control the ordering. I’ve added a bunch of statistics to show the flexibility: library(flextable) summstats %&gt;% tabulator(rows = &quot;Variable&quot;, columns = &quot;Treatment&quot;, `N` = as_paragraph(as_chunk(n,digits=0)), `Mean (SD)` = as_paragraph(as_chunk(fmt_avg_dev(mean, sd, digit1=2,digit2 = 2))), Range = as_paragraph(as_chunk(min,digits=3), &quot;-&quot;,as_chunk(max,digits=3)) ) %&gt;% as_flextable() .cl-3ca827bc{}.cl-3ca1ba30{font-family:'DejaVu Sans';font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0,

ttest, so I can cluster my standard errors etc. to this if I need to). Then I use summarize(across(...)) in much the same way as above, now to create a dataframe called difcol. library(estimatr) get_diffs &lt;- function(equation, clusters = NULL, weights = NULL, std.error = FALSE){ reg &lt;- lm_robust(equation, clusters = {{ clusters }}, weights = {{ weights }}) %&gt;% broom::tidy() estimate &lt;- round(reg[2,2],2) p &lt;- reg[2,5] stars = case_when(p &lt; 0.001 ~ &quot;***&quot;, p &lt; 0.01 ~ &quot;**&quot;, p &lt; 0.05 ~ &quot;*&quot;, .default = &quot;&quot; ) paste0(estimate,stars) } difcol &lt;- data %&gt;% select(where(is.numeric),-key_ID,treatment,village) %&gt;% summarize(across(.cols = c(everything(), -treatment, -village), .fns = ~get_diffs(.x ~ treatment, clusters = village))) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols =everything(), names_to = &quot;Variable&quot;, values_to=&quot;Difference&quot;) Then, all I have to do is add it to tabulator() using its datasup_last argument. Below, I also use a few other flextable function to make the table nicer. In particular, labelizor() to add variable labels, for which I use the named vector I defined above. descriptive_table_flex &lt;- summstats %&gt;% tabulator(rows = &quot;Variable&quot;, columns = &quot;Treatment&quot;, datasup_last = difcol, `N` = as_paragraph(as_chunk(n,digits=0)), `Mean (SD)` = as_paragraph(as_chunk(fmt_avg_dev(mean, sd, digit1=2,digit2 = 2)))) %&gt;% as_flextable() %&gt;% labelizor(j = &quot;Variable&quot;, labels = labels, part = &quot;body&quot;) %&gt;% fix_border_issues() %&gt;% autofit() descriptive_table_flex .cl-3cee01ec{}.cl-3ce7e5dc{font-family:'DejaVu

There is no glm_robust() function. You can estimate a probit model, then use coeftest() to get clustered standard errors, and then use the glance_custom method to add the number of clusters to that. However, you can create your own glm_robust function, with blackjack and hookers including tidy() and glance() methods that return everything you want to modelsummary(). I use vcovCR from the clubSandwich package to compute CR2 standard errors, which are the default in estimatr, so everything is nice and consistent with the linear probability model. # this function estimates a probit model, and # then computes the cluster-robust standad errors using # clubSandwich and coeftest # it returns a glm_robust object, which is just a modified # coeftest object glm_robust &lt;- function(formula,family,data,cluster, type = &quot;CR2&quot;) { library(lmtest) library(clubSandwich) probit &lt;- glm(formula, family = family, data = data) model &lt;- probit%&gt;% coeftest(., vcovCR({.}, cluster = data[[cluster]], type = type), save = TRUE) # this computes the number of unique clusters in the data used # for the original mode attr(model,&quot;nclusters&quot;) &lt;- data[row.names(model.frame(probit)),cluster] %&gt;% unique() %&gt;% nrow() class(model) &lt;- &quot;glm_robust&quot; model } # this is the custom tidy methods for glm_robust objects # it returns a dataframe with coefficients tidy.glm_robust &lt;- function(x, ...){ x[,] %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(term = attr(x,&quot;dimnames&quot;)[[1]]) %&gt;% select(term, estimate = Estimate, std.error = `Std.

Faceting Stacked bar chart with WUR template and observation counts Ordering of labels Lollipop plot Maps", " Plotting using ggplot Introduction Each chart built with ggplot2 must include the following: - Data - Aesthetic mapping (aes) - Geometric objects (geom) Thus, the template for graphic in ggplot2 is: &lt;DATA&gt; %&gt;% ggplot(aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;() Data Prep library(tidyverse) library(here) data &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% separate_longer_delim(items_owned, delim = &quot;;&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(value = 1) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned, values_from = value, names_glue = &quot;owns_{items_owned}&quot;, values_fill = 0) %&gt;% rowwise %&gt;% select(-&quot;owns_NA&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(number_items = sum(c_across(starts_with(&quot;owns_&quot;)))) Scatter plot A scatter plot uses geom_point() data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) + geom_point() To differentiate overlapping points, you can use transparency… data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) …or add jitter: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) + geom_jitter() To add groups, add the variable that defines the groups as an aesthetic mapping, either in the call to ggplot(), or the one in the geom_() function you use: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) + geom_jitter(aes(color = village)) Boxplot data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = &quot;tomato&quot;, width = 0.2, height = 0.2) Bar chart For a simple bar chart of counts: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = village)) And since stacked bar charts are not easy to read: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = village), position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Note that geom_bar() defaults to displaying counts. If you want something else, you can use the stat = option. stat = \"identity\" is especially useful, as it displays values as-is, allowing you to pre-process your data anyway you want, for example to get percentages: wall_plot &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(respondent_wall_type != &quot;cement&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(village, respondent_wall_type) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) %&gt;% mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) wall_plot Labels The labs() function changes labels, the scale_ family of functions change axes and legends: wall_plot + labs(title = &quot;Proportion of wall type by village&quot;, fill = &quot;Type of Wall in Home&quot;, x = &quot;Village&quot;, y = &quot;Percent&quot;) + scale_fill_discrete(labels=c(&#39;Burned briks&#39;, &#39;Mud Daub&#39;, &#39;Sun Bricks&#39;)) + scale_y_continuous(limits= c(0,100), n.breaks = 6) Faceting Faceting allows splitting a graph in multiple parts: data %&gt;% group_by(village) %&gt;% summarize(across(.cols = starts_with(&quot;owns_&quot;), .fns = ~sum(.x,na.rm=TRUE) / n() * 100, .names = &quot;{str_replace(.col, &#39;owns_&#39;, &#39;&#39;)}&quot;)) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-village, names_to = &quot;items&quot;, values_to = &quot;percent&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ items) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) Note that the .names argument to summarize(across()) is specified as a glue string that uses str_replace() to cut off the \"owns_\" bit of the column names. Stacked bar chart with WUR template and observation counts First, download the WUR template from here. Install it following the instruction on that page. Then we make a stacked bar chart using position = position_fill(). I use reverse = TRUE because I think the ordering doesn’t make sense in these horizontal plots. library(ggthemewur) data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = village, fill = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) + theme_wur() + scale_fill_wur_discrete() + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) I like the percentages, but perhaps it’s good to know how many observations we have in each village. We can do this by changing the village names: data %&gt;% group_by(village) %&gt;% add_count() %&gt;% mutate(village = paste0(village,&quot; (n =&quot;,n,&quot;)&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = village, fill = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) + theme_wur() + scale_fill_wur_discrete() + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) You can also put the counts inside the plot: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = village, fill = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) + theme_wur() + scale_fill_wur_discrete() + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + geom_text(stat = &quot;count&quot;, aes(label = after_stat(count)), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5, reverse = TRUE), color = &quot;white&quot;) Or as percentages: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = village, fill = respondent_wall_type)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) + theme_wur() + scale_fill_wur_discrete() + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + geom_text(aes(label = after_stat(scales::percent(count / sum(count),accuracy=1))), stat = &quot;count&quot;, position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5, reverse = TRUE), color = &quot;white&quot;) As a re-usable function These plot specifications can get quite complicated; if you need to re-use it many times throughout a report, it is worth taking the time to convert them to a fucntion: If you’re writing a report that includes the same type of plot in many places, it makes sense to make it into a function: library(ggthemewur) stacked_bar_plot &lt;- function(df, by, fill) { # outputs a stacked bar chart df %&gt;% mutate( {{ by }} := count_label( {{ by }})) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = {{ by }}, fill = {{ fill }})) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) + labs(x= &quot;&quot;) + theme_wur() + scale_fill_wur_discrete() + geom_text(stat = &quot;count&quot;, aes(label = after_stat(count)), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5, reverse = TRUE), color = &quot;white&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;) + guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1, title.position=&quot;top&quot;, title.hjust = 0.5)) } count_label &lt;- function(vector) { # takes a vector of strings or factor, # output a factor vector with N = N included in the labels fct_recode(factor(vector), !!!vector %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% group_by(value) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) %&gt;% mutate(value = as.character(value), newlabel = paste0(value,&quot;\\nn=&quot;,n)) %&gt;% pull(value, name = newlabel)) } read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% stacked_bar_plot(village,respondent_wall_type) read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% stacked_bar_plot(village,affect_conflicts) Note that the count_label() function adds group counts to factor variable labels. This is useful for the by variable. I am not sure if I understand what the !!! operator means, but it works. The function basically creates a named vector, where the vector values are the old factor labels, and the vector names are new factor labels. The new labels include the N, which is computed using a standard group_by() %&gt;% summarize() pipeline. Ordering of labels By default, ggplot will order categorical variables in your graph alphatically. With the wall types this was fine, but when the categories have an order, this doesn’t look good: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = village, fill = affect_conflicts)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) Here you’d expect the once category to be between more_once and never, not at the end. To fix this, convert the variable to a factor. The order in the levels argument will be the order in which the labels will be displayed: data %&gt;% mutate(affect_conflicts = factor(affect_conflicts, levels = c(&quot;frequently&quot;, &quot;more_once&quot;, &quot;once&quot;, &quot;never&quot;))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = village, fill = affect_conflicts)) + geom_bar(position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)) Note that the trick of adding group counts to string variables using add_count() doesn’t work with factors. Or rather, it works, but converts the factor back to a string. In the functions chapter, I define a function called count_label() that adds group counts to factor variables using black magic. Lollipop plot A lollipop plot is a nice alternative to a bar chart. Here is an example. It uses reorder to put the longest lollipops are at the top, and and the brewur() function to select four colors from the WUR theme. N = nrow(data) read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% separate_longer_delim(items_owned, delim = &quot;;&quot;) %&gt;% select(items_owned) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(items_owned)) %&gt;% group_by(items_owned) %&gt;% summarize(Count = n() / N) %&gt;% mutate(items_owned = reorder(items_owned, Count)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Count, y = items_owned)) + geom_linerange(aes(y = items_owned, xmin = 0, xmax = Count), color = &quot;gray&quot;) + geom_point(aes(x = Count, y = items_owned), size = 4, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), color = brewur()[[1]]) + theme_wur() + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) You can of course also group things, but this may mess up the ordering. Here I use complete to make sure that 0s ae properly displayed. The trick is to use position = position_dodge(width = 0.5). I use scale_color_manual() to set the colors to the first four WUR colors. read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(village) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## village n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Chirodzo 39 ## 2 God 43 ## 3 Ruaca 49 read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% # get list of items, and summarize to counts by village separate_longer_delim(items_owned, delim = &quot;;&quot;) %&gt;% select(village, items_owned) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(items_owned)) %&gt;% group_by(village, items_owned) %&gt;% summarize(Count = n()) %&gt;% # make sure 0s are explicit ungroup() %&gt;% complete(village, items_owned, fill = list(Count = 0)) %&gt;% # merge in village totals left_join(read_csv(here(&quot;data/SAFI_clean.csv&quot;), na = &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(village) %&gt;% summarize(n = n())) %&gt;% # compute percentages mutate(Percent = Count / n) %&gt;% mutate(items_owned = reorder(items_owned, Percent)) %&gt;% # plot ggplot(aes(x = Percent, y = items_owned, group = village)) + geom_linerange(aes(y = items_owned, xmin = 0, xmax = Percent), position = position_dodge(width = 1), color = &quot;gray&quot;) + geom_point(aes(x = Percent, y = items_owned, color = village), size = 4, position = position_dodge(width = 1)) + scale_color_manual(values = brewur()[1:4]) + theme_wur() + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) This graph is very crowded, so probably would need some changes. Perhaps facetting would have been better here, or you could manually tweak the y-values to create some whitespace.

This is useful for power analysis, because it is often hard to include things like clustering and covariates in standard power calculators. Resources for learning about DeclareDesign: Slides by the authors of DeclareDesign: Graeme Blair, Alex Coppock, Macartan Humphreys The DeclareDesign CheatSheet The book Research Design in the Social Sciences: Declaration, Diagnosis, and Redesign Read at least the slides before going forward! Simple Power Calculation Let’s first do some power calcuations. I will use Rhomis data from Burundi, you can get the data here. Loading data I do some data wrangling, like creating village codes based on y-coordinates, and some assorted cleaning. library(tidyverse) library(DeclareDesign) n_clusters = 18 rhomis &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data/RHoMIS_Indicators.csv&quot;)) %&gt;% #names() filter(Country == &quot;Burundi&quot;) %&gt;% # split the sample in villages, by lattitude filter(!is.na(GPS_LAT)) %&gt;% arrange(GPS_LAT) %&gt;% mutate(village = rep(1:n_clusters, each = nrow(.) / n_clusters , length.out = nrow(.))) %&gt;% select(village,HHsizeMAE,HouseholdType,Head_EducationLevel,LandOwned,HFIAS_status,NFertInput, total_income_USD_PPP_pHH_Yr) %&gt;% # create some variables mutate(HFIAS_status = factor(HFIAS_status, levels = c(&quot;FoodSecure&quot;, &quot;MildlyFI&quot;, &quot;ModeratelyFI&quot;, &quot;SeverelyFI&quot;)), food_secure = 1 * (as.numeric(HFIAS_status) &lt;= 3), educated = 1*(Head_EducationLevel != &quot;No_school&quot;), female = 1* (HouseholdType == &quot;woman_single&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(hh = row_number()) %&gt;% select(!HFIAS_status) %&gt;% # there are too many missings in my data; these seem reasonable to assume to be 0 when missing: mutate(across(c(LandOwned,NFertInput,educated), ~ if_else(is.na(.x),0,.x))) Declare Design Now it’s time to start declaring our design. The first element of the design is the model, using declare_model() which essentially is my data. declare_model() follows the syntax of fabricate(), which allows you to generate an entirely new dataset. For now we stick with existing data, but the syntax is still the same as fabricate(), so insead of using mutate() we can just supply new variables after a comma. In this case, I add potential outcomes, using potential_outcomes(). effect_size_simple &lt;- 70 model_simple &lt;- declare_model( rhomis, potential_outcomes(Y ~ NFertInput + Z * effect_size_simple) ) The potential outcomes are generated using potential_outcomes(). This will create two variables Y_Z_1 and Y_Z_0, which are the potential outcomes if having received treatment (Z == 1) or not. Note that I will generate Z in the next step. Then it’s time to think about assignment. I do a clustered randomization, based on the villages: assignment_simple &lt;- declare_assignment(Z = cluster_ra(clusters = village, prob = 0.5)) Next, I declare my theoretical quantity of interest is the treatment effect in year 1. This is basically my research question. inquiry_simple &lt;- declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) measurement_simple &lt;- declare_measurement( Y = reveal_outcomes(Y~Z) ) Since I won’t be able to observe Y_Z_1 for the control group, nor Y_Z_0 for the treatment group, I will need an estimation strategy. A simple difference in means: estimator_simple &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, clusters = village, inquiry = &quot;ATE&quot;, term = &quot;Z&quot;, label = &quot;Simple&quot;) Finally, I combine all these elements to declare my design. Note that it’s only here that R starts actually running the code to randomize things. The previous was just declaration! design_simple &lt;- model_simple + assignment_simple + inquiry_simple + measurement_simple + estimator_simple summary(design_simple) ## ## Research design declaration summary ## ## Step 1 (model): declare_model(rhomis, potential_outcomes(Y ~ NFertInput + Z * effect_size_simple)) ## ## N = 290 ## ## Added variable: village ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 1 9 9.44 18 5.23 0 18 ## ## Added variable: HHsizeMAE ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 0.6 4.36 4.46 9.29 1.77 0 171 ## ## Added variable: HouseholdType ## couple man_single polygamous woman_single ## 218 4 7 61 ## 0.75 0.01 0.02 0.21 ## ## Added variable: Head_EducationLevel ## N_missing N_unique class ## 70 6 character ## ## Added variable: LandOwned ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 0 1 5.39 1000 58.8 0 63 ## ## Added variable: NFertInput ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 0 16 72.71 7500 465.79 0 44 ## ## Added variable: total_income_USD_PPP_pHH_Yr ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 0 122 60727.83 16972222 996596.6 0 174 ## ## Added variable: food_secure ## 0 1 ## 160 130 ## 0.55 0.45 ## ## Added variable: educated ## 0 1 ## 106 184 ## 0.37 0.63 ## ## Added variable: female ## 0 1 ## 229 61 ## 0.79 0.21 ## ## Added variable: hh ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 1 145.5 145.5 290 83.86 0 290 ## ## Added variable: ID ## N_missing N_unique class ## 0 290 character ## ## Added variable: Y_Z_0 ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 0 16 72.71 7500 465.79 0 44 ## ## Added variable: Y_Z_1 ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 70 86 142.71 7570 465.79 0 44 ## ## Step 2 (assignment): declare_assignment(Z = cluster_ra(clusters = village, prob = 0.5)) ## ## Added variable: Z ## 0 1 ## 144 146 ## 0.50 0.50 ## ## Step 3 (inquiry): declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) ------------------- ## ## A single draw of the inquiry: ## inquiry estimand ## ATE 70 ## ## Step 4 (measurement): declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) ---------- ## ## Added variable: Y ## min median mean max sd N_missing N_unique ## 0 70 107.95 7500 464.23 0 61 ## ## Step 5 (estimator): declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, clusters = village, inquiry = &quot;ATE&quot;, term = &quot;Z&quot;, label = &quot;Simple&quot;) ## ## Formula: Y ~ Z ## ## A single draw of the estimator: ## term estimator estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high ## Z Simple -6.251284 58.90686 -0.1061215 0.9168062 -131.137 118.6344 ## df outcome inquiry ## 15.98618 Y ATE Note that the results of my three estimators are identical, which is as expected. Diagnosing Design and calculating power If you want to browse a version of the data created by your design, use the draw_data() function.

The diagnose_design() will run our model 500 times and our power is simply the fraction of times we find a statistically significant effect. set.seed(1) diagnose_design(design_simple) ## ## Research design diagnosis based on 500 simulations.

That’s way lower than the traditional 80% threshold. How large should our effect size be to reach a power of 0.8? We can use the redesign() function for this. Redesign allows you to vary certain parameters of your design, and run the design 500 times for each value of the parameter. Here I set it to run 200 times, as that takes long enough already. set.seed(1) diagnosis_simple &lt;- design_simple %&gt;% redesign(effect_size_simple = seq(100,300,50)) %&gt;% diagnose_design(sims = 200) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% as_tibble() Now, I want a nice plot. For this I filter the tibble I created, and pipe it into ggplot(): diagnosis_simple %&gt;% filter(diagnosand == &quot;power&quot;) %&gt;% select(effect_size_simple,power = estimate) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = effect_size_simple, y = power)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept=0.8,linetype=2) We can reliably detect an effect size between 150 and 200 kgs of fertilizer. The mean fertilizer use is 70kg, so that seems unlikely to be realistic. Perhaps we should add covariates to reduce the standard error? Adding more estimators I define another estimator that includes covariates in its model specification, and add it to my original design, hoping this will increase power. estimator_simple_cov &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + LandOwned + educated + female, clusters = village, inquiry = &quot;ATE&quot;, term = &quot;Z&quot;, label = &quot;Simple Cov&quot;) design_simple_cov &lt;- design_simple + estimator_simple_cov set.seed(1) diagnosis_simple_cov &lt;- design_simple_cov %&gt;% redesign(effect_size_simple = seq(100,300,50)) %&gt;% diagnose_design(sims = 200) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% as_tibble() diagnosis_simple_cov %&gt;% filter(diagnosand == &quot;power&quot;) %&gt;% rename(power = estimate) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = effect_size_simple, y = power, color = estimator, shape = estimator)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept=0.8,linetype=2) ## Error: object &#39;diagnosis_simple_cov&#39; not found Turns out it doesn’t help at all in this case. Dif in diff We can of course also opt for a diff-in-diff design. But then we have to pretend we have two rounds of data collection. For that, I prefer to use dplyr, but it should be possible with fabricate() as well. I first rename all our time-variant varaible to have _0 at the end, create a bunch of correlated varaibles with _1 at the end, and then pivot_longer. effect_size_dd &lt;- 70 sd_dd &lt;- 100 model_dd &lt;- declare_model( rhomis %&gt;% # add one more year rename_with(~ paste0(., &quot;_0&quot;), HHsizeMAE:female) %&gt;% mutate(food_secure_1 = correlate(given = food_secure_0, draw_handler = draw_binomial, prob = mean(food_secure_0) , rho = 0.9), HHsizeMAE_1 = HHsizeMAE_0 + rnorm(n = nrow(.), mean = 0, sd = 0.1), NFertInput_1 = pmax(0,NFertInput_0 + rnorm(n = nrow(.), mean = 0, sd = sd_dd))) %&gt;% pivot_longer(ends_with(c(&quot;_0&quot;,&quot;_1&quot;)), names_to = c(&quot;.value&quot;, &quot;t&quot;), names_pattern = &quot;(.*)_([0-9]+)$&quot;, values_drop_na = TRUE, names_transform = list(t = as.integer)), potential_outcomes(Y ~ NFertInput + Z * effect_size_dd) ) I modify the inquiry and assignment to only take into account t == 1 inquiry_dd &lt;- declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0), subset = (t == 1)) assignment_dd &lt;- declare_assignment(treatment_group = cluster_ra(clusters = village, prob = 0.5), Z = t * treatment_group) Measurement is unchanged: measurement_dd &lt;- declare_measurement( Y = reveal_outcomes(Y~Z) ) Then I use feols() from the fixest package to estimate a Two-way fixed effects (2FE) model. This can be easily extended to more complex designs (but beware!). library(fixest) library(broom) estimator_dd &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z | treatment_group + t, cluster = &quot;village&quot;, .method = feols, term = &quot;Z&quot;, inquiry = &quot;ATE&quot;, label = &quot;2FE&quot;) Let’s have a look at our power now! Of course, in a DiD setting, power depends not only on the effect size, but also on how well the years correlate. I therefore also vary the sd_dd variable, which adds increase between-year variation design_dd &lt;- model_dd + assignment_dd + inquiry_dd + measurement_dd + estimator_dd set.seed(1) diagnosis_dd &lt;- design_dd %&gt;% redesign(effect_size_dd = seq(10,90,20), sd_dd = c(100,200)) %&gt;% diagnose_design(sims = 100) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% as_tibble() Our power is now a lot better, even if we turn up the variance. However, this all depends on the correlation between years. If there is more between-year variation, you lose the benefits of a DiD design. diagnosis_dd %&gt;% filter(diagnosand == &quot;power&quot;) %&gt;% rename(power = estimate) %&gt;% mutate(sd_dd = factor(sd_dd)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = effect_size_dd, y = power, color = sd_dd, shape = sd_dd)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept=0.8,linetype=2) Propsensity score matching Finally, let’s imagine a Propensity Score matching scenario. We therefore need to pretend treatment isn’t random, but is correlated to the outcome. Let’s also look at food_secure, since it’s binary, and thus adds a twist here and there. Finally, I will use the resample_data() function to pretend that we can visit more households than are in my original data set. Declare Design Let’s put this in declare design. Treatment assignment is as follows: 50% of the villages are selected for treatment. This is just random. Roughly 50% of the households are selected. The selection indicator will have a correlation of rho with the household being educated, using fabricatr’s correlate() function. Education is also a strong predictor of food_security, creating inherent bias. I compare a standard difference in means, as well as a custom matching function that uses the MatchIt package to create a balanced data set, that I can then use for regular regressions, weighted by the propensity score. rhomis_psm &lt;- rhomis %&gt;% mutate(Head_EducationLevel = if_else(is.na(Head_EducationLevel),&quot;No_school&quot;, Head_EducationLevel), income = mean(total_income_USD_PPP_pHH_Yr, na.rm = TRUE) + rnorm(n(), 0, 1000), income = income + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;primary&quot;, 5000, 0) + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;secondary&quot;, 10000, 0) + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;adult_education&quot;, 20000, 0) + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;postsecondary&quot;, 50000, 0), prob_treat = 0.3, prob_treat = prob_treat + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;primary&quot;, 0.1, 0) + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;secondary&quot;, 0.2, 0) + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;adult_education&quot;, 0.3, 0) + if_else(Head_EducationLevel == &quot;postsecondary&quot;, 0.4, 0), ) set.seed(1) library(MatchIt, exclude(&quot;select&quot;)) # the select function would conflict with dplyr # this syntax requires R 4.0 or higher # set parameters effect &lt;- 10000 #rho &lt;- 0.2 rhomis_psm %&gt;% mutate(sample = draw_binary(prob = prob_treat)) %&gt;% count(sample) ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## sample n ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 177 ## 2 1 113 rhomis_psm %&gt;% mutate(sample = simple_ra(N= nrow(.), prob_unit = prob_treat)) %&gt;% count(sample) ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## sample n ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 173 ## 2 1 117 population_psm &lt;- declare_population( # rhomis %&gt;% # mutate(treated_hh = correlate(given = educated, draw_handler = draw_binary, prob = 0.5 , rho = rho), # potential_outcomes(Y ~ pmin(1,food_secure + Z * draw_binary(effect,nrow(.))))) N = nrow(rhomis), rhomis, #potential_outcomes(Y ~ pmin(1,food_secure + Z * draw_binary(effect,N))) potential_outcomes(Y ~ income + Z * effect) ) assignment_psm &lt;- declare_assignment( treated_hh = simple_ra(N= nrow(.), prob_unit = prob_treat), treated_vill = cluster_ra(clusters = village, prob = 0.5), Z = treated_hh * treated_vill ) I then re-sample from the original data using resample_hhs() I define below. To include the function in our design, we need to use declare_step() I ensure I have more control household than treatment households. I drop any untreated households in treated villages. Compared to the treatment hhs in each cluster, I sample twice the number of control hhs. This simulates that we can’t get control households in treated villages, for example due to fears of clusters_treat &lt;- 50 hh_treat &lt;- 15 clusters_control_multi &lt;- 1 # multiplier for oversampling control clusters hh_control_multi &lt;- 2 # multiplier for oversampling control hhs resample_hhs &lt;- function(data){ # this function filters any control households in treated communities # and it sets the sample size data %&gt;% mutate(drop = if_else(treated_vill == 1 &amp; treated_hh == 0,1,0)) %&gt;% filter(drop != 1) %&gt;% # sample from treated villages and untreated villages group_by(treated_vill) %&gt;% do({ if (unique(.$treated_vill) == 1) { resample_data(., N = c(village = clusters_treat, hh = hh_treat),unique_labels = TRUE) } else { resample_data(., N = c(village = clusters_control_multi * clusters_treat, hh = hh_control_multi * hh_treat), unique_labels = TRUE) } }) } resampling_psm &lt;- declare_step( handler = resample_hhs ) Measurement and inquiry are standard. I also add an OLS estimator to check for bias. measurement_psm &lt;- declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z) ) inquiry_psm &lt;- declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0) ) estimator_notmatched_psm &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, clusters = village_unique, inquiry = &quot;ATE&quot;, term = &quot;Z&quot;, label = &quot;Not matched&quot;) Finally, I need to somehow put my matching model in DeclareDesign. Fortunately, you can put any the output of any function into the declare_estimator() function using the handler argument. It does need to accept a data argument, and output a tidy() dataframe. My function custom_match() accepts a data frame, uses MatchIt to create a matched data set, I define a function that does that, and some labelling: custom_match &lt;- function(data, equation, outcome = &quot;Y&quot;, term = &quot;Z&quot;) { # the command filter(term == term) wouldn&#39;t do anything, so this is a workaround term_value &lt;- term # run the matching model matchit_model &lt;- matchit(equation, data = data, method = &quot;nearest&quot;) matched_df &lt;- match.data(matchit_model) # run a regression, weighted by the propensity score lm_robust(Y ~ Z, clusters = village_unique, data = matched_df, weights = weights) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% mutate(outcome = outcome) %&gt;% filter(term == term_value) } estimator_matched_psm &lt;- declare_estimator( Z ~ HHsizeMAE + educated + LandOwned + NFertInput + female + NFertInput, handler = label_estimator(custom_match), inquiry = &quot;ATE&quot;, # Tie the estimator to the declared inquiry label = &quot;Matched&quot;, term = &quot;Z&quot;, ) design_psm &lt;- population_psm + inquiry_psm + assignment_psm + resampling_psm + measurement_psm + estimator_notmatched_psm + estimator_matched_psm Checking balance It’s useful to explore the property’s of our matching estimator. First I draw data based on my design and create matched version of that data. set.seed(1) test_data &lt;- draw_data(design_psm) %&gt;% as_tibble() ## Error: Error in step 1 (): ## Error: object &#39;income&#39; not found matchit_model &lt;- matchit(Z ~ HHsizeMAE + educated + LandOwned + NFertInput + female + NFertInput, data = test_data, method = &quot;nearest&quot;) ## Error: object &#39;test_data&#39; not found matched_df &lt;- match.data(matchit_model) ## Error: object &#39;matchit_model&#39; not found Then I create balance table for the test_data: library(modelsummary) library(flextable) # balance table test_data %&gt;% mutate(Z = factor(Z, labels = c(&quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Treatment&quot;))) %&gt;% select(Z, Y, food_secure, HHsizeMAE, educated, LandOwned, NFertInput, female, NFertInput) %&gt;% datasummary_balance( ~ Z , data = ., output = &quot;flextable&quot;, stars = TRUE, dinm = TRUE, dinm_statistic = &quot;p.value&quot;) %&gt;% fix_border_issues() %&gt;% autofit() ## Error: object &#39;test_data&#39; not found And for the matched_df, which is clearly more balanced. Note that according to the documentation, datasummary_balance() reports weighted means if a weights variable is present. matched_df %&gt;% mutate(Z = factor(Z, labels = c(&quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Treatment&quot;))) %&gt;% select(Z, Y, food_secure, HHsizeMAE, educated, LandOwned, NFertInput, female, NFertInput) %&gt;% datasummary_balance( ~ Z , data = ., output = &quot;flextable&quot;, stars = TRUE, dinm = TRUE, dinm_statistic = &quot;p.value&quot;) %&gt;% fix_border_issues() %&gt;% autofit() ## Error: object &#39;matched_df&#39; not found Let’s run the models two times: unmatched_model &lt;- lm_robust(Y ~ Z, clusters = village_unique, data = test_data) ## Error: object &#39;test_data&#39; not found matched_model &lt;- lm_robust(Y~Z, clusters = village_unique, data = matched_df, weights = weights) ## Error: object &#39;matched_df&#39; not found modelsummary(list(lm = unmatched_model, psm = matched_model), output = &quot;flextable&quot;, gof_map = c(&quot;nobs&quot;,&quot;r.squared&quot;,&quot;adj.r.squared&quot;)) ## Error: object &#39;unmatched_model&#39; not found Both of these underestimate the treatment effect by a bit, as it should be around 0.2. Bias Now, let’s diagnose the design! First, let’s examine bias, given selection effects. The strength of the selection effect is given by rho, so I use redesign() to vary it: diagnosis_psm_bias &lt;- design_psm %&gt;% redesign(rho = seq(from = 0, to = 0.9, by = 0.3)) %&gt;% diagnose_design(sims = 100) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% as_tibble() And I put the result in a plot: diagnosis_psm_bias %&gt;% filter(diagnosand == &quot;bias&quot;) %&gt;% select(rho, bias = estimate, estimator) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = bias, shape = estimator, color=estimator)) + geom_line() + geom_point() Clearly, the more treatment is correlated to education, the higher the bias in the regular model. Bias is never extreme, however. Power Then, let’s examine power. diagnosis_psm_power &lt;- design_psm %&gt;% redesign(clusters_treat = c(20,40,60), effect = seq(0.1,0.4,0.1)) %&gt;% diagnose_design(sims = 100) %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% as_tibble() When we plot the results, it seems sample size doesn’t affect power much (not sure why, perhaps the resampling?). The design can pick up an effect of 0.4, meaning that 40% of the food insecure beneficaries become food secure. The actual treatment effect would be lower, as some beneficiaries would have been food secure before the intervention. diagnosis_psm_power %&gt;% filter(diagnosand == &quot;power&quot;) %&gt;% select(clusters_treat, power = estimate, estimator, effect) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = clusters_treat, y = power, shape = estimator, color=estimator)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept=0.8,linetype=2) + facet_wrap(~effect) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
