# Making sure your packages keep working

## Introduction

The power of R lies in the many packages that are available.
However, here also lies a risk:
there's no guarantee packages keep working the way they work now,
meaning that any update may break your work.
However, you shouldn't stay at an old version of a package for all your work,
just so that one old project of yours will keep working.
What if you want to collaborate with someone using a newer version of that 
package?

`renv` gets around this by instead of having a global package library, 
it has a project-specific project-library.

## Starting a project with Renv

In RStudio, just tick the box "use renv" when creating a new project.
Otherwise, type `renv::init()`
