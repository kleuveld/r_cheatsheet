# Data Wrangling

## Basic Data Manipulation


Below we do some basic data manipulations on our interview data.



```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

interviews %>%
    filter(village == "Chirodzo") %>%
    mutate(people_per_room = no_membrs / rooms,
           day = day(interview_date),
           month = month(interview_date),
           year = year(interview_date)) %>%
    select(key_ID:rooms, day:people_per_room, -village) %>%
    filter(interview_date > "2016-12-1" & interview_date < '2017-01-01')

```

Note:

- We filter a number of rows using the `filter()` function
- We create some new variables using mutate. Note that for some date operations we use the `lubridate` library, wich is include in the tidyverse. Check out [lubridate's documentation](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) for more advanced date manipulation techniques.
- We select some of our variables using `select()`; note that you can
select a range of variables using `varaible1:variable2` and drop variables
using the `-`.
- We "chain" all these operations together using the [pipe operator](https://uc-r.github.io/pipe) `%>%`.


## Pivoting (or reshaping)

When you want to combine two data frames at different levels of analysis, 
for example a household roster with the rest of the household questionnaire,
you'll run into the problem that the household roster has more rows than the 
household questionnaire: the household roster will have each row repeated for
each household member (i.e. it is *long* data). To combine it with the household data data we need to make sure the columns are repeated for each member (ie make the data *wide*). In R, this is done using the 
`pivot_wider()` function, which works much like Stata's `reshape` command.


### Creating fake data

First, let's create some long data, so we have something to pivot. 
We will make sure that our household roster has a number of lines
for each household that is equal to the household size, and has two
randomly generated variables: `female` and `age`.

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

long_data <- 
    interviews %>%
    select(key_ID,no_membrs ) %>%
    uncount(no_membrs) %>%
    group_by(key_ID) %>% 
    mutate(member_ID = row_number()) %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(female = sample(0:1,1),
           age = case_when(member_ID == 1 ~ sample(18:86,1),
                          .default = sample(0:86,1))) %>%
    ungroup()

long_data

```

Note that this uses some advanced data wrangling:

- `uncount()` to inflate each number of rows by the number of members in the household.
- `group_by(key_ID)` and `row_number()` to generate the row number within all
observations with the same key_ID.
- `rowwise()` to ensure randomizations are run over each row, rather than once
for the entire data set.
- `sample()` to get random integers.
- `case_when()` to make sure the age is never lower than 18 if the member_id is 1 (presumably the household head).

### Pivoting long to wide

To merge this into our main data set, we need to make sure we go back to having 1 observation per household. We will do this by using `pivot_wider()`:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

wide_data <-
    long_data %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = member_ID,
                values_from = !ends_with("_ID"))
wide_data
```

We only needed to specify two options:

- names_from: this is the column that contains the names (or usually numbers)
for each of our units of analysis. In this case, the `member_ID`.
- values_from: the variables containing the data. All variables you specify here, will get one column for each possible value of names_from. In our case, these variables `female` and `age`. I used [tidy select syntax](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tidyr_tidy_select.html) to specify all variables except the ones ending in "\_ID". 

`pivot_wider()` will assume all variables not specified in names_from and values_from are the unique identifiers of your wide data. In our case, the
only remaining variable is `key_ID`, which is indeed the unique identifier.


### Pivoting wide to long

If we had started with wide data, and had wanted to transform to
long data, we'd have to use `pivot_longer()`:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

recreated_long_data <-
    wide_data %>%
    pivot_longer(!key_ID, 
                 names_to = c(".value", "member_ID"),
                 names_sep="_",
                 values_drop_na = TRUE)
long_data

```

In this case, the syntax is a bit harder to understand than that of pivot wider. It's good to think first what the original data looks like, and 
how we intend to transform it. The wide data has columns key_ID, age_1-19 and female_1-19. We don't really want to touch the key_ID
column. We want to turn the columns age_1-19 and female_1-19 into three columns: female, age and Member_ID, which contains the values 1-19. This translates to the options we passed to `pivot_longer()` as follows:

- `!key_ID`: We want to pivot the data that's in all columns except key_ID. 
- `names_to = c(".value", "member_ID")`: this specifies the new columns we want to create. It basically says that the existing column names consist of two parts: one part (i.e. female and age) that we wish to keep as column names , and one part (i.e. the numbers 1-19) which should be put into a new column which we will "member_ID".
- `"names_sep="`: this indicates how the two parts mentioned above are 
separated. If there is no separator (for example your variables are called age1, age2, etc.) you'll have to use the`names_pattern` option.
- `values_drop_na = TRUE`: tells R to drop rows that have missing data for 
all variables. If we had set this to FALSE, we'd have 19 rows for each
household, with a lot of missing data in all households smaller than 19 people.

## Joining (or merging) data

Tidyverse has four functions to join (or merge, as Stata calls it) two
data sets. The functions that differ in the way they treat observations that are in one data set but not the other. 
Consider the diagram below. 
It has two data sets, `x` (in Stata terms, this is the master data set) and `y` (the using 
data set in Stata terms). They have overlapping rows (area B), but also
rows that are only in `x` (area A) or only in `y` (area C).

![](images/join_venn.png)

The four join functions work as follows:

- `inner_join()` will only keep area B.
- `left_join()` will keep areas A and B.
- `right_join()` will keep areas B and C.
- `full_join()` will keep areas A, B, and C.

In our case, the data sets match perfectly, i.e. we only have an area B, so there is no practical difference. I chose `left_join()` so the number of 
observations in my household survey is guaranteed to remain the same.
To merge the roster to the household data, we use the join_by function:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

interviews %>%
    left_join(wide_data)

```

Note that we didn't specify identifiers, like we would in Stata. R 
assumed that the variables that appear in both data frames are the 
identifiers, in this case `key_ID`. Use the `by` option to change this.

Going the other way around, joining the household data to the 
roster data, is equally easy:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

long_data %>%
    left_join(
        interviews %>% 
            select(key_ID,village,interview_date))
```
Note that here I only merged in two variables, by using `select` and a pipe within the `left_join()` function.

## Summarizing over groups (or collapsing data)

To compute summary statistics (sums, counts, means etc.) over a group,
we use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions. For example, to
compute the household size, number of women and average age in each household:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

long_data %>%
    group_by(key_ID) %>%
    summarize(hh_size = n(), num_women = sum(female), mean_age = mean(age))    
```

## Advanced Row Wise Operations

Suppose we wanted to get the above information (the household size, number of women and average age in each) from the wide data. The easiest,
and probably best, way to do this in R is by reshaping to long, and do the above.
But in Stata you would probably use some sort of `egen` function, and you
can do similar things in R. It's just a bit more complex:

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,warning=TRUE,error=TRUE,message=FALSE}

wide_data %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(mean_age = mean(c_across(starts_with("age_")),
                           na.rm=TRUE),

           num_women = sum(c_across(starts_with("female_")),
                           na.rm=TRUE),
           hh_size = sum(!is.na(c_across(starts_with("female_"))),
                         na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
    select(key_ID,hh_size,num_women,mean_age) %>%
    ungroup()


```

The key trick here is the combination of `rowwise()` and `c_across()`.
`rowwise()` ensure all summaries are computed per row, and `c_across()`
allows you to use [tidy select](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html) syntax within the `mean()` and `sum()` functions.
`sum(!is.na())` simply counts the non-missing values.
